## Types

Types are generated by supabase through the CLI through inferring them from the db schema:

```bash
# Locally
supabase gen types typescript --local > supabase/functions/_shared/database.types.ts
# or remote project:
# supabase gen types typescript --project-id <project-ref> > supabase/functions/_shared/database.types.ts
```
